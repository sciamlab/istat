                               The working group “<b>Il dato è tratto</b>” was born from among communication professionals (designers, journalists) and experienced
							   data and sotware engineers.<br/><br/>
                               The group is made of:
                           </p>
                           <ul>

                                This combination is the result of a joint evaluation, enriched by knowledge related to various professional fields: on one side, the broad field of visual design;
								and in the other, that of open data.<br/><br/>
                                The visualization of complex data - and then return to the citizens of useful information in an understandable form - is at the center of this reflection.
								To operate in this "new" area of ​​expertise is needed hybridization of competences and skills.<br/><br/>

                                The team was questioned mainly on the concept of "visible form". In particular, he focused on the passage that leads to an aesthetic of form due to
								the classical idea (stable, defined, closed) towards an aesthetic of flows, in which the forms are galvanizing and change over time, affecting volumes
								now calculated petabytes, on the multiplicity of data / information from the value maximized and the speed of administration and uptake by the user.
								The result is the representation of the "passages of information" that alter the contours of stable signifiers.<br/><br/>

                                It is from this premise that designers, journalists, developers have begun to operate in an effort to provide the public with new communications
								tools dynamic, sophisticated, interactive, that are not within the exclusive prerogative of computer technicians both in conception and in use,
								nor that favor less formal coherence to the detriment of the information itself. Instead, they are designed User Experience thinking of the end
								user, so with a design-oriented approach.<br/><br/>

                                
								Goal of the work is therefore to enable the public to interact with the complexity of the information; the user is not understood, therefore,
								as a passive receiver of input, but as a subject that can, in turn, to develop strategies to query the data for their own use and consumption.<br/><br/>
								
								If the modern aesthetic locates in rational form that element of union and decoding of the <i>"res cogitans and res extensa"</i>, 
								if industrial society questions on the infinite reproducibility of the shape / object, contemporary aesthetics crosses borders and
								stable set of the form , proposing it as a hybrid of the action "constructivist" user and the data streams that he himself is able to query, if enabled.<br/><br/>

								The results of these types of experiences, rapidly advancing globally, affect significantly the evolution of both social and industrial sectors.<br/><br/>

                            <h3>The Istat contest</h3>
                            <p>
                                The working group “<b>Il dato è tratto</b>” has designed an application divided into two parts:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>Best/worst</b></li>
                                <li><b>The best place</b></li>
                            </ol>
                            <img src="img/screen-home.jpg" alt="datotratto home" class="img-responsive"/>
                            <p>
                                In the section <b>Best/worst</b> we propose a dynamic view of Italian regions and provinces that change shape and color
								scheme depending on the intersection of the selected dataset.<br/><br/>

                                The user can choose, for example, to cross the given population in a given area with the given propensity recruitment
								in the same territory and have, through an immediate glance, the picture of the situation.<br/><br/>

                                So those who use the service can form an idea, not ruling, but backed up by real data and science.<br/><br/>

                                You can also modify the data according to the greater or lesser interest to be granted to individual indicators, in the
								"What is more important": it is a weighted average of the two indicators generalized polar and to compare the data
								with respect to the needs of 'user.<br/><br/>

                                Interaction with the application, the public is able to form some general ideas on the concept of development in our
								country, its excellence, its contradictions, its shadows.
                            </p>
                            <img src="img/screen-best-worst.jpg" alt="best/worst" class="img-responsive"/>
                            <p>
                                In the section <b>The best place</b> the user is asked to express his desired in terms of employment and occupation.
								He is then asked to make choices, always personal, which deal with the themes of culture and the environment: the data
								crossed the return the territory closer to its desired location ie the "cozier" than required.<br/><br/>

                                The data in this context loses its value merely quantitative and impersonal, vice versa is used for reconfiguration serving the needs of the user.
                            </p>
							<img src="img/screen-best-place.jpg" alt="best/place" class="img-responsive"/>
                            <p>
                                These are just examples that invite us to reflect on the potential that this type of approach to visual / interactive
								media can generate as widespread, that is open and service.<br/><br/>

                                The citizen is not merely the passive recipient of the communication (both commercial and institutional), but is able to "produce information.".<br/><br/>

                                AIn this sense the "shape-law" is no longer static, enclosed in the grammatical and syntactic structure of legal codes, 
								or in its actualization entrusted to the heterogeneity of trading territorial policies, but is subject to the control 
								and to the extent that they are objective of all democratic systems. The process of nucleation of a particular law and 
								its exercise are thus traced to a unique extent that its true scope, effectiveness and functionality.<br/><br/>

                                The hybrid competences of the team - journalism, graphic design, communication and software - find their osmosis
								mainly in the spirit of "service" of the common work.
