Il dato e' tratto
=================

This is an experimental data visualizion based on 3D choropleths that demonstrate how
GeoJSON geometries projected into WebGL 3D canvas and statistical data coming from the [ISTAT 2011 industry and services census][1] 
can be combined to create interactive and immersive data exploration.


Technologies
------------
The entire application exploit the [WebGL][2] features that come with [HTML5 canvas element](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element) and modern browser to interact with onboard GPU and
efficently manipulate complex 3D objects and scenarios.
