Il dato e' tratto
=================

This is an experimental data visualizion based on 3D choropleths that demonstrate how
GeoJSON geometries projected into WebGL 3D canvas and statistical data coming from the [ISTAT 2011 industry and services census][#1] 
can be combined to create interactive and immersive data exploration.


Technologies
------------
The entire application exploit the [WebGL][#2] features from Khronos that can embed 3D objects into the [HTML5 canvas element](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element)
and that is now available in almost all the modern browsers.
WebGL basedon OpenGL use the onboard accelerated Graphics Processors (GPUs) and efficently manipulate complex 3D objects and scenarios

WebGL Supported Browsers
-------------------------
WebGL is today supported in many browsers, but in case you experience any issues in displaying it in your device you can refer to the [Compatibility Grid][#3].
